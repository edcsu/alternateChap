## Simulate Restful service
Whenever you start Angular dev server be sure to start json-server too.

json-server package in the project creates web services from JSON data or JavaScript code.

To start the RESTful web service, open a command prompt and run the following command in the Chapbon folder:
 `npm run json` which is short for `json-server data.js -p 3500 -m authMiddleware.js`

Navigate to `http://localhost:3500/` 
You can change the port in the package.json file where;
    ...
    "scripts": {
    "ng": "ng",
    "start": "ng serve",
    "build": "ng build",
    "test": "ng test",
    "lint": "ng lint",
    "e2e": "ng e2e",
  #  "json": "json-server data.js -p 3500 -m authMiddleware.js"
    },
    ...
